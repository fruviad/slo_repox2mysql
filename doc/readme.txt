  The purpose of this set of files is to easily parse
  REPOX configuration data into SQL files for a MySQL
  database.

  Run the scripts while resident in the root directory
  of this set of files.

  Output will be put into the "output" directory, and
  can be run individually or en mass via a script under
  the lib directory (load-all.sql)

  Java and Saxon are required, as are mysql client.
